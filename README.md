# Association for Pathology Informatics R Workshop

This introductory R workshop aims to teach participants with minimal programming experience the basics of the R statistical programming language for reproducible laboratory data analytics. R is a freely available programming environment that is aimed squarely at common activities in data analysis including complex data manipulation, statistical analysis, automation, and robust visualization. We will introduce basic concepts of R programming as well as more generalizable best practices in working with laboratory data. 

- Instructors: 
  * Daniel Herman
  * Stephan Kadauke
  * Patrick Mathias
  * Amrom Obstfeld
  * Joseph Rudolf


## Pre-course work/requirements

- A laptop with wifi, access to the internet, and the ability to download files is required
  - Confirm you can connect to conference wifi prior to class
- Complete the following survey so we can better understand your R experience and what you want out of the course: [API R Workshop Participant Survey](https://forms.gle/4ireLkLiKedkgoWa7)
- The program that we will be using to interact with R during the course is called RStudio. We will be sending out a link to a pre-configured cloud based instance of RStudio. Our intent in using cloud-based platform for the workshop is to minimize possible in-class setup issues. Please confirm that you can open the link and successfully sign in.

## Installing RStudio onto your own computer

Working with our cloud based RStudio instance will be the most reliable way to proceed through the workshop. However, in the long term, you will need R and RStudio installed on your own computer in order to work on private or PHI containing data. You can find a video with step by step instructions for installing on Mac or PC by following the links below:

- [Windows Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRKmZK5-6aE) 

## Accessing/interacting with the course content

There are multiple ways to access and interact with the course content, depending on whether you choose to proceed through the workshop using the cloud based RStudio or one on your own laptop. 
1. If you choose to use the the cloud based RStudio instance, all the course content is pre-loaded. 
1. If you would prefer to run RStudio on your own computer, download the course material from the course github [repository](https://github.com/amromeo/api_r2019) as a *.zip file from [here](https://github.com/amromeo/api_r2019/archive/master.zip). 
   * Unzip the file to a convenient location (your desktop or documents folder)
   * When you open RStudio, set this location as your working directory 

## The day of the workshop

The workshop is scheduled to begin at 8 am sharp. In order to make ensure that we can begin on schedule please make every effort to arrive 10 - 15 minutes early to allow time to get settled, get your laptop set up, and get RStudio up and running.

## Acknowledgments

All of the course instructors have previous experience implementing and executing R workshops at a variety of venues. The workshop we are presenting for the API community is in many ways a product of these past experiences. The workshop also integrates content, best practices, and lessons from a variety of educators in the R community. We would like to specifically acknowledge: 

- [MSACL Data Science 201](https://github.com/pcmathias/MSACL-intermediate-R-course), a course produced by Patrick Mathias and several collaborators, presented at the Mass Spectrometry: Applications to the Clinical Lab meeting.
- Stephan Kadauke's R workshop for Pathology trainees and faculty
- Steve Master and Dan Holmes's AACC Introduction to R Workshop 
- [Data Science in the Tidyverse](https://github.com/AmeliaMN/data-science-in-tidyverse), a RStudio course with materials posted online
- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html), the online textbook by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, is invaluable in navigating the tidyverse and learning R in general
- Blog posts and documentation by [Jenny Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc) helped steer the project content and as well as some discussion about packages
- Amy Willis' [Advanced R Course repository](https://github.com/adw96/biostat561) as a resource for understanding content in a longer, advanced R course
- Keith Baggerly and Karl Broman's [Reproducible Research](https://github.com/kabagg/sisbid_2018_rr) module at the [Summer Institute in Statistics for Big Data](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/suminst/sisbid) - a big thank you to Keith Baggerly for all of his input and guidance!
- Method validation and some other content has been borrowed from the [basic R course at AACC](https://github.com/pcmathias/AACC-Introduction-to-R)
